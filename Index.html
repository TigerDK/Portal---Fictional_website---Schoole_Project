            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>Portal is designed to change the way players think about and interact with their environment. Using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, you’ll solve physics-based puzzles and challenges by opening portals to move objects and yourself through space. Similar to the groundbreaking mechanics introduced with Half-Life® 2's Gravity Gun, Portal redefines what’s possible in gaming.</p>
            <p>You play as Chell, navigating a series of test chambers under the watchful eye of GLaDOS, Aperture Science’s darkly humorous AI. With every solved puzzle, you’ll uncover more about the secrets of Aperture Science and the eerie motives behind your tests.</p>
